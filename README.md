# Hacknet4CMD: C++ Edition
Hacknet4CMD is a legacy project, last updated about 1 year ago yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Before make C++ ver, I just joined "Hacknet For CMD | Official Server" from Discord.
<br/>
<br>
Then, a person "65536Java (NULL)" joined and sent a program about Hacknet4CMD.
<br/>
And, this program remade Hacknet4CMD with Java.
<br/>
<br>
So, I made a program remade Hacknet4CMD in a day.
<br/>
With C++, just like "Minecraft: Bedrock Edition" lol.
