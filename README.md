# Hacknet For CMD (C++)
"Hacknet for CMD" originally by AhQiang and uses Batch for code, but changed to C++ by Skiawm91 for code now.
<br/>
## Some parts are different from AhQiang's "Hacknet For CMD"
All text to English.
### 1. Boot
I deleted all codes about wmic, because I didn't know how to convert to C++. 
<br/>
Then, wmic deleted in Windows 11 24H2.
<br/>
I also hid systeminfo output.
### 2. Login UI
If password invalid will uses MessageBox.
